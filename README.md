# Sleepy-DTI: Open-source connectivity analysis using the Sleepy Brain Project I dataset

The ['Sleepy Brain Project I'](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000201/) (SBP) is a multimodal brain imaging dataset studying the effects of sleep deprivation in young and old human subjects.

The dataset contains:
1. **Demographics, surveys, questionnaire data**
2. Eye tracking data
3. High resolution T1-weighted and T2-weighted structural scans
4. B0 field map data
5. **Diffusion-weighted imaging scans**
6. DNA analysis results

## Proposal
As part of the [OnlineBrainIntensive](https://www.onlinebrainintensive.com/) course, the main aim of this project is to explore the diffusion tensor images collected as part of the study and correlate the results with behavioural measure. The effects of sleep deprivation on connectivity measures will also be examined.
